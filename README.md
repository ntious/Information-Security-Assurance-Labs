## 🧪 Labs Aligned to Outcomes

Each lab is designed to support one or more learning outcomes.

* **Lab 1: Information Asset Inventory**
  *Outcome 1* – Create an inventory of IT assets (hardware, software, data) and classify their value.

* **Lab 2: Threat Identification & Risk Matrix**
  *Outcome 2* – Build a risk assessment matrix to evaluate and prioritize threats.

* **Lab 3: Security Strategy & Architecture**
  *Outcome 3* – Propose layered security controls (people, process, technology).

* **Lab 4: Intrusion Detection Simulation**
  *Outcome 4* – Simulate a brute force or port scan and create a response plan.

* **Lab 5: Ethical Issues Case Study**
  *Outcome 5* – Analyze real-world scenarios (privacy breaches, AI bias, data misuse).

* **Lab 6: Laws & Regulations Review**
  *Outcome 6* – Research and present security/privacy laws (HIPAA, FERPA, GDPR, etc.) with practical applications.

* **Lab 7: Disaster Recovery Plan**
  *Outcome 7* – Draft a disaster recovery plan for a hypothetical organization.
