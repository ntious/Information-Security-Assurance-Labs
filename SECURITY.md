# Security Policy

Thank you for taking the time to help keep this repository and its users safe.

This repository is used for **teaching Information Security & Assurance** and does **not** contain production systems, private student data, or real infrastructure. However, we still care about good security practices.

## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue (for example: a leaked secret, an unsafe script, or a vulnerable dependency):

1. **Do NOT open a public issue or pull request describing the vulnerability.**
2. Instead, please contact the maintainer privately at:

   **Email:** `ntious1+git@gmail.com`  
   **GitHub:** [@ntious](https://github.com/ntious)

Include:

- A description of the issue  
- Steps to reproduce (if applicable)  
- Any relevant screenshots or logs  

We will review your report, investigate, and respond as soon as possible.

---

## 🔐 Scope

Examples of issues that are in scope:

- Exposed API keys, passwords, or access tokens  
- Hard-coded credentials in scripts or configuration files  
- Insecure default configurations in lab materials that could leak data if reused in the real world  
- Vulnerable dependencies used in the examples (especially if they’re exploitable by students)

Out of scope for this educational repo:

- Intentional vulnerabilities included for lab exercises  
- Issues that only affect a student’s **local environment** (e.g., weak passwords they choose for themselves)  
- Theoretical vulnerabilities that cannot be reasonably exploited in this context

---

## 🧑‍🏫 Student Guidance

- Do **not** commit any personal, institutional, or production secrets to this repository or to your forks.
- Treat all example keys and passwords in the labs as **fake** and for educational use only.
- If you accidentally commit a real secret, contact the maintainer immediately so it can be revoked and rotated.

Thank you for helping us maintain a safe and responsible learning environment.
Please email: ntious1+git@gmail.com
We will review and patch any findings.
