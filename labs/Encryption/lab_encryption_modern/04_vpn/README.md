# Lab 04 — VPN Concepts (WireGuard & OpenVPN)

**Activity (analysis-only)**
1. Read `wireguard_example.conf` and identify: interface address, peer public key, endpoint, AllowedIPs.
2. Read `openvpn_client_example.ovpn` and identify: remote, cipher, auth, embedded certs/keys.
3. Short compare: VPN vs SSH vs TLS (layering, routing, split vs full tunnel).

**Deliverable**
- 5–8 bullet points summarizing how VPNs secure traffic and how they differ from SSH/TLS.
