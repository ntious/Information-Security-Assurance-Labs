# Lab 2: Asset Classification and Prioritization

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this lab is to evaluate the importance of organizational assets using **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA)** criteria and assign overall classification levels. Students will learn how to prioritize information security assets so organizations can allocate resources effectively.

---

## 📖 Background

Not all assets are equally important to an organization’s security posture. Some systems (like medical records or financial databases) are more critical than others (like public websites or office furniture).

By assigning **CIA ratings** and overall classification levels, organizations can:

* Focus protection on high-value assets.
* Allocate resources where they are most needed.
* Build security strategies that align with operational priorities.

This activity supports the course learning outcomes:
👉 Evaluate assets using CIA criteria
👉 Prioritize assets based on sensitivity and criticality
👉 Justify classification decisions for high-priority assets

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

* Completed **Activity 1 Excel file** (Asset Identification and Categorization)
* Knowledge of CIA Triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)
* Microsoft Excel (or equivalent spreadsheet software)

---

## 📝 Tasks

### Step 1 – Open Your Inventory

* Use your completed Excel file from **Activity 1**.
* Navigate to the sheet: **`Phase 1 (Activity 2)`**.

### Step 2 – Assign CIA Ratings

For each **“Yes” (InfoSec) asset** identified in Activity 1, assign ratings:

* **Confidentiality** → High / Medium / Low
* **Integrity** → High / Medium / Low
* **Availability** → High / Medium / Low

### Step 3 – Determine Overall Classification

Based on CIA ratings, assign an overall classification:

* **Critical** → Essential to operations; loss has severe impact
* **High** → Important but not as vital as Critical
* **Medium** → Moderate importance; manageable impact
* **Low** → Minimal operational or security impact

### Step 4 – Provide Justification for Critical Assets

* For every asset marked **Critical**, add a short explanation.
* Example: *EHR System – “Critical”: contains sensitive patient data and is essential for clinical operations.*

### Step 5 – Save and Submit

* Save your file as:

  ```
  GroupNumber_OrganizationName_Phase1_2.xlsx
  ```
* Each student must **submit the same group file individually** before leaving class.

## 📂 Deliverables

* Completed Excel file including:

  * CIA ratings for each asset
  * Overall classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
  * Justifications for all **Critical** assets

---

## ✅ Evaluation Criteria

* **Accuracy** – Are CIA ratings appropriate?
* **Reasoning** – Are justifications for Critical assets clear?
* **Prioritization** – Are assets classified consistently?
* **Collaboration** – Did the group produce a coherent result?

## 📘 Learning Outcomes

By completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Evaluate organizational assets using CIA principles.
* Prioritize assets based on criticality.
* Justify classification decisions with clear reasoning.
* Collaborate effectively to create a prioritized inventory.

---

## 🧩 Guidelines for Determining Criticality

* **Operational Impact**

  * High: Essential for daily operations; major disruption if lost
  * Medium: Important but not immediately essential
  * Low: Minimal impact if lost

* **Business Continuity**

  * High: Loss severely affects ability to deliver services
  * Medium: Loss manageable with alternatives or delay
  * Low: Easily replaced; minimal impact

* **Dependency and Usage**

  * High: Used across multiple units; loss affects many
  * Medium: Used by a few departments
  * Low: Rarely used; limited scope

## 📊 Example Classification Table

| Asset Name        | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability | Classification | Justification (if Critical)      |
| ----------------- | --------------- | --------- | ------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Customer Database | High            | High      | High         | Critical       | Contains sensitive customer data |
| ERP System        | High            | High      | High         | Critical       | Supports core business functions |
| Employee Laptops  | Medium          | Medium    | High         | High           | –                                |
| Public Website    | Medium          | Medium    | High         | High           | –                                |
| Financial Records | High            | High      | Medium       | High           | –                                |
| Security Training | Low             | Low       | Medium       | Medium         | –                                |
