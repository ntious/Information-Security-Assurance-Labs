# Lab 5: Developing Risk Mitigation Strategies

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this lab is to move from **risk assessment to risk treatment** by designing strategies that reduce or eliminate significant risks. You will propose both technical and non-technical solutions, categorize them as preventive, detective, or corrective, and justify your recommendations.

---

## 📖 Background

In **Activity 4**, you assessed risks by evaluating likelihood and impact, then assigned overall risk ratings.

Now, in **Activity 5**, you will:

* Select the **top risks** (High or Medium)
* Develop **risk mitigation strategies**
* Classify strategies into control types
* Provide **justifications** for why each strategy is suitable

This activity supports the course learning outcomes:
👉 Define an information security strategy and architecture
👉 Plan for and respond to intruders in an information system
👉 Develop practical and actionable risk response strategies

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

* Completed Excel file from **Activity 4** (with risk ratings)
* Understanding of security controls (preventive, detective, corrective)
* Familiarity with both technical (encryption, firewalls) and non-technical (policies, training) approaches

---

## 📝 Tasks

### Step 1 – Select Top Risks

* From Activity 4, select **2–4 of the most significant risks** (High or Medium).
* Use the sheet: **`Phase_1_Activity_5`**.
* Do not include Low risks unless your group feels strongly.

### Step 2 – Design Strategies

For each selected risk:

* Propose at least **two strategies**.
* Label each strategy as:

  * **Preventive** – stops the risk from occurring (e.g., strong passwords, access controls)
  * **Detective** – identifies when an incident occurs (e.g., IDS, monitoring logs)
  * **Corrective** – recovers or minimizes damage (e.g., backups, incident response plan)
* Ensure strategies include both **technical and non-technical** elements.

### Step 3 – Justify Each Strategy

* Provide a short (1–2 sentence) explanation of **why each strategy is appropriate and feasible**.

### Step 4 – Save and Submit

* Save your file as:

  ```
  GroupNumber_OrganizationName_Phase1_5.xlsx
  ```
* Each student must **submit the same group file individually** before leaving class.

## 📂 Deliverables

* A completed **Risk Mitigation Table** including:

  * Top 2–4 risks (from Activity 4)
  * At least 2 mitigation strategies per risk
  * Control classification (Preventive, Detective, Corrective)
  * Justification for each strategy

* **Optional Bonus (Extra Credit):** Creativity and innovation in proposed strategies

---

## ✅ Evaluation Criteria

* **Relevance** – Are the strategies directly addressing the identified risks?
* **Variety** – Are both technical and non-technical approaches included?
* **Classification** – Are strategies correctly categorized as preventive, detective, or corrective?
* **Justification** – Are explanations clear and concise?
* **Collaboration** – Group effort is visible, but individual submission required

---

## 📘 Learning Outcomes

By completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Develop realistic strategies for mitigating risks
* Distinguish between preventive, detective, and corrective controls
* Justify security strategies in context of feasibility and effectiveness
* Translate risk assessment into actionable security planning

## 📊 Example Risk Mitigation Table

| Risk (from Activity 4)               | Mitigation Strategy                                      | Control Type | Justification                                                     |
| ------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Weak password policies → Data Breach | Implement MFA for all users                              | Preventive   | Adds a second layer of security even if passwords are compromised |
|                                      | Deploy password manager & enforce strong password policy | Preventive   | Ensures users create and store complex, unique passwords          |
|                                      | Monitor login attempts with SIEM alerts                  | Detective    | Detects brute-force or credential stuffing in real-time           |
|                                      | Regular phishing awareness training                      | Preventive   | Reduces likelihood of credential theft via phishing               |

## ⚠️ Ethical Reminder

The goal of this activity is to **strengthen systems through effective defenses**. Risk mitigation strategies must always be applied responsibly and ethically.
