# Labs Overview – Information Security and Assurance

Welcome to the **lab activities** for this course. These labs are designed to guide you step-by-step through the foundations of **risk management and information security strategy**, as well as introduce you to **encryption fundamentals**.

> ⚠️ **Note**: All labs are **group activities**, but each student must submit individually to ensure participation and accountability.

## 📌 Phase 1: Information Security Asset Management & Risk

### 🔹 Activity 1 – Information System Asset Identification

* **Goal**: Build an inventory of organizational assets and decide which are information security–relevant.
* **Skills**: Asset identification, classification into categories (people, procedures, data, software, hardware, networking).

---

### 🔹 Activity 2 – Asset Classification and Prioritization

* **Goal**: Assign **CIA ratings (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability)** and overall classification (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
* **Skills**: Evaluating asset sensitivity, prioritizing information security assets.

---

### 🔹 Activity 3 – Threat and Vulnerability Identification

* **Goal**: Identify threats, vulnerabilities, and threat sources for each security asset.
* **Skills**: Threat modeling, vulnerability recognition, threat-source mapping.

---

### 🔹 Activity 4 – Qualitative Risk Assessment

* **Goal**: Assess the **likelihood** and **impact** of each threat–vulnerability pair, then assign a **risk rating** using a matrix.
* **Skills**: Risk evaluation, qualitative analysis, prioritization of risks.

---

### 🔹 Activity 5 – Developing Risk Mitigation Strategies

* **Goal**: Create actionable strategies to reduce or eliminate the top risks (2–4 High/Medium risks).
* **Skills**: Designing preventive, detective, and corrective controls; justifying and planning mitigation measures.

---

## 🔐 Bonus Lab: Classical Encryption

### 🧩 Classical Ciphers Toolkit

* **Goal**: Explore encryption and decryption using **11 major historical ciphers** (Caesar, Atbash, Vigenère, Playfair, Hill, etc.).
* **Skills**: Cryptographic fundamentals, substitution vs. transposition, block ciphers, weaknesses of classical methods.
* **Deliverable**: Short report testing at least 3 ciphers with plaintext → ciphertext → decrypted plaintext examples.
