# Lab 1: Information System Asset Identification in Risk Management

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this lab is to introduce students to **asset identification and prioritization** as the foundation of risk management. Students will practice determining which assets qualify as information security assets and categorizing them into standard groups.

---

## 📖 Background

The first step in protecting an organization is **understanding what assets exist and which ones are most relevant to information security**. Not all assets carry the same level of risk. By identifying and classifying critical assets, organizations can prioritize protection efforts and build stronger security strategies.

This activity supports the course learning outcome:
👉 **Identify and prioritize information assets**

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

* Microsoft Excel (or Google Sheets/LibreOffice equivalent)
* Basic understanding of information security principles (confidentiality, integrity, availability)
* Familiarity with asset types: people, processes, data, software, hardware, networking

---

## 📝 Tasks

### Step 1 – Select Your Organization

Choose **one** of the following:

* **Organization 1:** HealthFirst Clinic (Healthcare)
* **Organization 2:** InnovateX (Tech Startup)
* **Organization 3:** BrightFuture University (Educational Institute)

### Step 2 – Download the Excel File

* Access the pre-filled asset list for your chosen organization.
* Open the sheet named: **`Phase 1_Activity_1`**.

### Step 3 – Review Each Asset

* Carefully read the name and description of each asset.

### Step 4 – Decide Information Security Relevance

* Mark **Yes (Y)** if the asset is an information security asset.
* Mark **No (N)** if it is not relevant.
* Provide a **brief reason** for your decision.

💡 *Example:*

* **Customer Database** → Y
* **Reason:** Contains personal and financial information that must remain confidential.

### Step 5 – Categorize Assets (Yes Only)

Assign each “Yes” asset to one of the following groups:

* **People** – individuals (users, administrators, staff)
* **Procedures** – policies, processes, workflows
* **Data** – information, records, digital files
* **Software** – applications, programs, operating systems
* **Hardware** – physical devices (servers, laptops, IoT devices)
* **Networking** – routers, switches, firewalls, internet connections
* **Other** – general assets not in the above groups (e.g., office furniture)

### Step 6 – Save and Submit

* Save your completed file as:

  ```
  GroupNumber_OrganizationName_Phase1_1.xlsx
  ```
* Each student must upload the same group file **individually** before leaving class.

## 📂 Deliverables

* Completed Excel file with:

  * Y/N relevance decisions
  * Justifications for each decision
  * Categorized asset groups

---

## ✅ Evaluation Criteria

* **Accuracy** – Did you correctly identify security-relevant assets?
* **Reasoning** – Did you provide clear justifications for your decisions?
* **Categorization** – Did you assign assets to the correct groups?
* **Collaboration** – Did your group work together effectively?

---

## 📘 Learning Outcomes

By completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Identify whether an asset is relevant to information security.
* Justify reasoning for classifying assets as security-related.
* Categorize assets into standard groups (people, procedures, data, software, hardware, networking, other).
* Collaborate to create a structured asset inventory for later **risk assessment**.

---

## 🧩 Notes

* Asset categories used here are simplified from standards such as **ISO 27001** and **NIST SP 800-60**.
* This assignment is **group work** but requires **individual submission**.

## ⚠️ Ethical Reminder

Information security is about **protecting information and systems** from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Misuse of these methods is strictly prohibited.
