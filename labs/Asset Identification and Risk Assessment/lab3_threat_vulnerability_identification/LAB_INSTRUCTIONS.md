# Lab 3: Information Assets Threat and Vulnerability Identification

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this lab is to identify **threats, vulnerabilities, and threat sources** that could compromise information security assets. This activity builds on previous work and sets the foundation for **risk assessment and prioritization** in later activities.

---

## 📖 Background

In **Activity 1**, you created an asset inventory.
In **Activity 2**, you classified each asset using **CIA ratings** (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).

Now, you will expand that work by identifying:

* **Threats** → Events or actions that can harm assets
* **Vulnerabilities** → Weaknesses that make exploitation possible
* **Threat Sources** → The actor or event that initiates the threat

This activity supports the course learning outcomes:
👉 Identify and prioritize threats to information assets
👉 Recognize vulnerabilities in information systems
👉 Document threats and vulnerabilities systematically

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

* Completed Excel file from **Activity 2** (with CIA ratings)
* Knowledge of common threats (phishing, ransomware, DDoS, etc.)
* Familiarity with vulnerabilities (weak passwords, unpatched systems, misconfigurations)

---

## 📝 Tasks

### Step 1 – Open Your File

* Use your group’s Excel file from **Activity 2**.
* Navigate to the sheet: **`Phase_1_Activity_3`**.

### Step 2 – Identify Threats

For each “Yes” (InfoSec) asset:

* Add at least **one threat** (e.g., phishing, ransomware, theft, DDoS).

### Step 3 – Identify Vulnerabilities

* For each threat, note the **weakness that makes it possible** (e.g., weak password policy, missing patches, no encryption).

### Step 4 – Identify Threat Sources

* Specify **who/what** could carry out or cause the threat (e.g., hacker, careless employee, disgruntled insider, natural disaster).

### Step 5 – Record Your Findings

* Enter information in the new columns:

  * **Threat**
  * **Vulnerability**
  * **Threat Source**
* Keep brief group notes for class discussion.

### Step 6 – Save and Submit

* Save your file as:

  ```
  GroupNumber_OrganizationName_Phase1_Activity3.xlsx
  ```
* Each student must **submit the same group file individually** before leaving class.

## 📂 Deliverables

* Updated Excel file containing:

  * Asset ID and Asset Name (from Activity 1)
  * CIA Ratings (from Activity 2)
  * Threat, Vulnerability, Threat Source (new columns in Activity 3 sheet)

---

## ✅ Evaluation Criteria

* **Completeness** – At least one threat, vulnerability, and source per asset
* **Specificity** – Entries are realistic and not overly generic
* **Clarity** – Explanations are clear and easy to understand
* **Collaboration** – Evidence of group discussion and participation

---

## 📘 Learning Outcomes

By completing this lab, you will be able to:

* Identify potential threats for each asset
* Recognize vulnerabilities that increase risk
* Determine threat sources (actors/events)
* Document findings in a structured way for risk analysis

## 📊 Example Table

| Asset ID | Asset Name        | Threat              | Vulnerability                | Threat Source        |
| -------- | ----------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 001      | Customer Database | Data Breach         | Weak password policies       | External attacker    |
| 002      | ERP System        | Ransomware Attack   | Lack of software updates     | Cybercriminal group  |
| 003      | Employee Laptops  | Physical Theft      | No disk encryption           | Insider/Outsider     |
| 004      | Website           | DDoS Attack         | Insufficient server capacity | Hacktivist group     |
| 005      | Financial Records | Unauthorized Access | Poor access control          | Disgruntled employee |
